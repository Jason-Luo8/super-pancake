## How to play
This **two player** game is set on a **3 x 3** grid. Each player chooses a mark, either X or O, to play with. Players will take alternating turns to place one piece per turn.

The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) is the winner! When all 9 squares are full with no clear winner, the game ends in a draw.
